Uploads one or more files to a target AEM instance. The upload process uses the
direct binary access algorithm, so the target instance must have direct binary
access enabled; otherwise the upload will fail.

The process will upload the files or directories (non-recursive) provided in
the command.

Note that the process will only work with AEM instances that use basic
(i.e. non-SSO) authentication.`
